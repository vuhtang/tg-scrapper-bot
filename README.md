# Telegram "Scrapper" Bot

The bot allows you not to read much flood in chats and receive messages from the people you choose.
This bot is personal, so it means that only one person can use it at a time.

## How it works
There is a Telegram bot. Here it is: @MessageScrapperBot.
* Send him a "*/start*" command to start working, otherwise the bot will not start it with you, oddly enough.
* Command "*/subs*" will show your current subscriptions
* Command "*/addsub*" will add you a new subscription, "*/delsub*" vice versa
* Command "*/cancel*" will stop receiving

Both client and bot Telegram API used here. When it comes to receiving messages, Telegram itself comes into play. Bot can not start dialog with real user. So messages will come from my old friend (whom I bought online for 14 rub)
